# ðŸš— Customer Behavior Case Study in the Automotive Industry

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior in the automotive industry by exploring how various car featuresâ€”such as price, safety, horsepower, and fuel typeâ€”impact customer acceptability and purchasing decisions. The dataset used in this analysis contains critical car attributes, including buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, person capacity, size of luggage, and safety ratings.

### ðŸ“Š Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the relationships between car attributes and customer preferences through visualizations like correlation heatmaps and distribution plots.
- **Classification Modeling**: A Random Forest classifier is used to predict car acceptability based on features like safety and price.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the most influential car features using feature importance metrics from the Random Forest model.

### ðŸš€ Technologies:
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- **car_data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **Car_Purchase_Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, visualizations, and model building.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Findings:
1. **Horse Power is the most important feature**: Horse_power has the highest impact on car acceptability based on the latest model.
2. **Person Capacity is also highly important**: The ability of a car to accommodate more passengers is a critical factor in determining acceptability.
3. **Safety Ratings are significant**: Cars with low safety ratings are less likely to be accepted by consumers.
4. **Number of Doors plays a moderate role**: While not as important as other features, the number of doors has some impact on car acceptability.
5. **Luggage Size and Safety_med are less significant**: These features play a smaller role in influencing customer decisions.
