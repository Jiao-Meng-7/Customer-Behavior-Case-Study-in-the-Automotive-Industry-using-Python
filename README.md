# ðŸš— Customer Behavior Case Study in the Automotive Industry

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior in the automotive industry by exploring how various car featuresâ€”such as price, safety, horsepower, and fuel typeâ€”impact customer acceptability and purchasing decisions. The dataset used in this analysis contains critical car attributes, including buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, person capacity, size of luggage, and safety ratings.

### ðŸ“Š Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the relationships between car attributes and customer preferences through visualizations like correlation heatmaps and distribution plots.
- **Classification Modeling**: A Random Forest classifier is used to predict car acceptability based on features like safety and price.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the most influential car features using feature importance metrics from the Random Forest model.

### ðŸš€ Technologies:
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### ðŸ“‚ Files Included:
- `car_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Car_Purchase_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, visualizations, and model building.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Findings:
1. **Safety is the most important feature**: Safety has the highest impact on car acceptability, followed by price.
2. **Price Sensitivity**: Lower buying and maintenance costs significantly increase the likelihood of a car being accepted by consumers.
3. **Practical Features Matter**: Person capacity and luggage size also play a crucial role in customer decisions, especially for larger families.
4. **Horsepower is less significant**: Customers prioritize safety and affordability over performance in their purchasing decisions.
